        We reserve the right to amend this Agreement (including the Privacy Policy and any Specific Terms of Service) at any time by notifying you as provided in this Agreement. Your continued use of the Services after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms of this Agreement, do not use or access (or continue to access), the Services.

        You must be a resident of the United States of America. We provide non-USA country and other geographic options to those registering only for the convenience of the user who resides in the USA but who prefer to use an address in another country to facilitate their interaction with Clients and other users. By way of example, a resident of Pennsylvania who is seeking an internship or educational opportunity in China may prefer to use a mailing address in China if they feel it would increase the likelihood of the employer or school accepting their application.

        You must also be at least eighteen (18) years of age or the age of majority in the jurisdiction, whichever is older, in which you reside so that you can form a binding contract with College Recruiter.
        
        You may not use the Services if your use of the Services has been previously terminated or suspended by College Recruiter unless we provided you with specific written authorization to re-use the Services.
